# Module 12 Challenge

### NoSQL Databases Challenge 
Assignment Submission by: Andrea Aguilar


In Part 1 of this assignment, we set up our database and configured our Jupyter Notebook by importing our Json resource file into MongoDB. 

In Part 2, we updated our database adding a new restaurant and deleting the establishments that were not of interest. We also converted several fields into numeric formats. 

Lastly in Part 3, we focused on exploratory analysis by performing various queries on the dataset. This allowed us to  gain valuable insights about the data and answer specific questions about the establishments and ratings.
